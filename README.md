　　我见老婆喜欢这只小狗了，就笑说：哪给它起名字，等你给它起啊。
　　海面上不时的有热气球飘过，心里痒痒的，只是时间太太匆忙了，否则一定要过把隐，飘在蓝天下，飘在海面上，那将是怎样的刺激和浪漫啊。
　　随着时间的推移，也渐渐的理解了这词的意境。第一句，“无言”活画出词人的愁苦，“独上”二字勾勒出作者孤身登楼的身影，让人感觉到作者内心隐喻了不知多少的孤寂与凄凉。“月如钩，寂寞梧桐深院锁清秋”此句描绘出了作者登楼后见到的景色，如那如钩的残月般，经历了无数次的阴晴圆缺，见证了人世间的悲欢离合，今夜，当词人独自登上孤楼，又怎能不勾起人的离愁别恨呢？俯视庭院，“梧桐”叶儿已被无情的秋风扫荡殆尽，只剩下光秃秃的树干和几片残叶在秋风中瑟瑟缩缩，又怎能不“寂寞”？然而“寂寞”的又怎能只是这株“梧桐”？连“深秋”都被锁在这深院之中了，然而“锁”的又何止这“深秋”？落魄的人，孤寂的心，凄凉的秋，思乡的情，亡国的恨，都表现在这一句词里，让人不免有些呜咽。

When I was in the mountains, also once ran to the woods, was dry moss, covered the tombstone of the handwriting, the fuzzy words by trees dripping wet with water, sticking to the accident after ants of difficult movements.
No sunshine in the woods, the light in darkness.
I sit inside, imagined ghosts and gods and fairies in the branches of the first flying, fighting, and crying.
The child's heart, there is no adult to the horrors of the tomb.
They lined up neatly in the woods, a group of a group of can let a person to identify a thread of the family.
The decline of old grave, grave collapsed in the bushes, the vines grow up day by day, and around the handwriting, no one can see those words, whether to record how many sorrows and fatigue.
